# Obsidian
A top tier UCI chess engine written in c++, that I started developing in april 2023.


### Neural network

Obsidian evaluates positions with a neural network trained on Lc0 data.
Trivial endgames are evaluated with a special function instead.


### Credits
* To Witek902, for letting me in his OpenBench instance, allowing me to use massive hardware for my tests
* To fireandice, for training the neural network of Obsidian 9.0
* The NNUE of obsidian is trained with https://github.com/jw1912/bullet
